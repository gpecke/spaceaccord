        <h1 id="space-our-new-frontier">Space, Our New Frontier</h1>
<p>This site hopes to encourage dialogue and interest in the
exploitation of space, motivated by the rapid advance of AI and
robotics, and the resulting commercial activity. It aims to elicit
feedback from specialists as well as the general public.</p>
<p>AI has become the game changer for space developments for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potentially greatly reduced equipment design and testing time, and
reduced equipment costs.</li>
<li>Elimination of the risk and enormous cost involved with manned
missions.</li>
<li>Mining, exploration and Earth return demand intelligent responses to
unforeseen events – these activities become impossibly expensive if
human‑crewed.</li>
<li>The importance of an efficient way of monitoring and reducing the
possibility of unwanted impact of natural and manmade debris.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site maintainers believe it would be wise to consider a planned
and mannered approach to the use of space, taking into account the
successes and failures of development on Earth. An overly idealistic
framework would be better than none. AI has risks we don’t yet fully
understand, and the nature of space could accelerate those risks.</p>

<h2 id="components-of-a-possible-accord">Components of a Possible
Accord</h2>
<ul>
<li>Principles of resource sharing</li>
<li>Agreed limits to militarisation</li>
<li>Lunar land rights</li>
<li>Mining rights (lunar and asteroidal)</li>
<li>Earth orbit allocations and cleanup</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-glossary">Technical Glossary</h2>
<p>The aim of this glossary is to describe and support some of the
statements made in the main body. It is hoped that readers will be
prepared to comment, and if necessary, suggest revisions or additions.
The glossary is intended to be purely factual.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Communication in space is by radio and by light beams. Radio is
suitable for lower‑bandwidth and broadcast transmissions, such as from
LEO/HEO (Low to High Earth Orbit) to Earth. Laser beams are capable of
very high bandwidth anywhere in our solar system. All space
communication involves long delays – from seconds for the Moon to hours
for the outer planets and asteroids.</p>
<h3 id="temperature">Temperature</h3>
<p>The space environment can involve large fluctuations in temperature.
Equipment needs resilience or special protection measures.</p>
<h3 id="composition-of-space-matter">Composition of Space Matter</h3>
<p>The Moon, Mars and possibly Mercury have compositions similar to that
of the Earth. This is not true for the other planets, or for asteroids,
which have varying compositions.</p>
<h3 id="return-to-earth">Return to Earth</h3>
<p>Sending material back from an asteroid involves escaping the body’s
gravity, and changing the orbit of the material so that it travels in a
new orbit around the Sun and planets which intersects that of the Earth
to enter the Earth’s atmosphere. The magnitude of the vector change of
the orbital velocity required to send material to Earth is termed
<strong>ΔV</strong> and can be significantly less than 100 m/s, making
it possible to use a catapult to return material from an asteroid.</p>
